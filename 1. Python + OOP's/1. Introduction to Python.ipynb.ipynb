    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for its **simplicity**, **readability**, and **versatility**. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**. Python supports multiple programming paradigms including **procedural**, **object-oriented**, and **functional** programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîë Key Features of Python:\n",
    "- **Easy to learn and use** ‚Äì Simple syntax similar to English.\n",
    "- **Interpreted language** ‚Äì Code runs line by line, no need to compile.\n",
    "- **Dynamically typed** ‚Äì No need to declare variable types.\n",
    "- **Vast ecosystem of libraries** ‚Äì NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.\n",
    "- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n",
    "- **Large community support** ‚Äì Plenty of tutorials, documentation, and forums.\n",
